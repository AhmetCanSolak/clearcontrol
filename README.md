### RTlib - Real-Time and High-Performance Control Library ###


ClearControl philosophy is that it is possible to design control software in
Java for high-performance microscopes with a minimum of native code by
leveraging the best Java practices and libraries available. 


### How to build the project? ###

* Building ClearControl:

to build the project:

    ./gradlew build

To generate eclipse project files:

    ./gradlew eclipse

To clean-up modified eclipse project files:

    ./gradlew cleanEclipse

That's it, now you can import the ClearControl project in Eclipse. 


* Dependencies
Some dependencies could not be found online - they are added into the Libs folder for now...

### Work in PROGRESS!!!! ###

Currently the maturity of the code in the different packages can be estimated by the number of tests and whether they pass...
Documentation will follow after code has stabilised.
